      "When _Manasses_ [1] set up a carved image in the house of the Lord, and\r\n",
      "built altars in the two courts of the house, to all the host of Heaven, and\r\n",
      "us'd inchantments and witchcraft, and familiar spirits, and for his great\r\n",
      "wickedness was invaded by the army of _Asserhadon_ King of _Assyria_, and\r\n",
      "carried captive to _Babylon_; the book of the Law was lost till the\r\n",
      "eighteenth year of his grandson _Josiah_. Then [2] _Hilkiah_ the High\r\n",
      "Priest, upon repairing the Temple, found it there: and the King lamented\r\n",
      "that their fathers had not done after the words of the book, and commanded\r\n",
      "that it should be read to the people, and caused the people to renew the\r\n",
      "holy covenant with God. This is the book of the Law now extant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When [3] _Shishak_ came out of _Egypt_ and spoil'd the temple, and brought\r\n",
      "_Judah_ into subjection to the monarchy of _Egypt_, (which was in the fifth\r\n",
      "year of _Rehoboam_) the _Jews_ continued under great troubles for about\r\n",
      "twenty years; being _without the true God, and without a teaching Priest,\r\n",
      "and without Law: and in those times there was no peace to him that went\r\n",
      "out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the\r\n",
      "inhabitants of the countries, and nation was destroyed of nation, and city\r\n",
      "of city, for God did vex them with all adversity_. But [4] when _Shishak_\r\n",
      "was dead, and _Egypt_ fell into troubles, _Judah_ had quiet ten years; and\r\n",
      "in that time _Asa_ built fenced cities in _Judah_, and got up an army of\r\n",
      "580000 men, with which, in the 15th year of his reign, he met and overcame\r\n",
      "_Zerah_ the _Ethiopian_, who had conquered _Egypt_ and _Lybia_, and\r\n",
      "_Troglodytica_, and came out with an army of 1000000 _Lybians_ and\r\n",
      "_Ethiopians_, to recover the countries conquered by _Sesac_. And after this\r\n",
      "victory [5] _Asa_ dethroned his mother for idolatry, and he renewed the\r\n",
      "Altar, and brought new vessels of gold and silver into the Temple; and he\r\n",
      "and the people entered into a new covenant to seek the Lord God of their\r\n",
      "fathers, upon pain of death to those who worshiped other Gods; and his son\r\n",
      "_Jehosaphat_ took away the high places, and in the third year of his reign\r\n",
      "sent some of his Princes, and of the Priests and Levites, to teach in the\r\n",
      "cities of _Judah_: and they had the book of the Law with them, and went\r\n",
      "about throughout all the cities of _Judah_, and taught the people. This is\r\n",
      "that book of the Law which was afterwards lost in the reign of _Manasses_,\r\n",
      "and found again in the reign of _Josiah_, and therefore it was written\r\n",
      "before the third year of _Jehosaphat_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same book of the Law was preserved and handed down to posterity by the\r\n",
      "_Samaritans_, and therefore was received by the ten Tribes before their\r\n",
      "captivity. For [6] when the ten Tribes were captivated, a Priest or the\r\n",
      "captivity was sent back to _Bethel_, by order of the King of _Assyria_, to\r\n",
      "instruct the new inhabitants of _Samaria_, in _the manner of the God of the\r\n",
      "land_; and the _Samaritans_ had the _Pentateuch_ from this Priest, as\r\n",
      "containing the law or _manner of the God of the land_, which he was to\r\n",
      "teach them. For [7] they persevered in the religion which he taught them,\r\n",
      "joining with it the worship of their own Gods; and by persevering in what\r\n",
      "they had been taught, they preserved this book of their Law in the original\r\n",
      "character of the _Hebrews_, while the two Tribes, after their return from\r\n",
      "_Babylon_, changed the character to that of the _Chaldees_, which they had\r\n",
      "learned at _Babylon_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And since the _Pentateuch_ was received as the book of the Law, both by the\r\n",
      "two Tribes and by the ten Tribes, it follows that they received it before\r\n",
      "they became divided into two Kingdoms. For after the division, they\r\n",
      "received not laws from one another, but continued at variance. _Judah_\r\n",
      "could not reclaim _Israel_ from the sin of _Jeroboam_, and _Israel_ could\r\n",
      "not bring _Judah_ to it. The _Pentateuch_ therefore was the book of the Law\r\n",
      "in the days of _David_ and _Solomon_. The affairs of the Tabernacle and\r\n",
      "Temple were ordered by _David_ and _Solomon_, according to the Law of this\r\n",
      "book; and _David_ in the 78th Psalm, admonishing the people to give ear to\r\n",
      "the Law of God, means the Law of this book. For in describing how their\r\n",
      "forefathers kept it not, he quotes many historical things out of the books\r\n",
      "of _Exodus_ and _Numbers_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The race of the Kings of _Edom_, before there reigned any King over\r\n",
      "_Israel_, is set down in the book of [8] _Genesis_; and therefore that book\r\n",
      "was not written entirely in the form now extant, before the reign of\r\n",
      "_Saul_. The writer set down the race of those Kings till his own time, and\r\n",
      "therefore wrote before _David_ conquered _Edom_. The _Pentateuch_ is\r\n",
      "composed of the Law and the history of God's people together; and the\r\n",
      "history hath been collected from several books, such as were the history of\r\n",
      "the Creation composed by _Moses_, _Gen_. ii. 4. the book of the generations\r\n",
      "of _Adam_, _Gen._ v. i. and the book of the wars of the Lord, _Num._ xxi.\r\n",
      "14. This book of wars contained what was done at the Red-sea, and in the\r\n",
      "journeying of _Israel_ thro' the Wilderness, and therefore was begun by\r\n",
      "_Moses_. And _Joshua_ might carry it on to the conquest of _Canaan_. For\r\n",
      "_Joshua_ wrote some things in the book of the Law of God, _Josh._ xxiv. 26\r\n",
      "and therefore might write his own wars in the book of wars, those being the\r\n",
      "principal wars of God. These were publick books, and therefore not written\r\n",
      "without the authority of _Moses_ and _Joshua_. And _Samuel_ had leisure in\r\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_, to put them into the form of the books of _Moses_ and\r\n",
      "_Joshua_ now extant, inserting into the book of _Genesis_, the race of the\r\n",
      "Kings of _Edom_, until there reigned a King in _Israel_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book of the _Judges_ is a continued history of the _Judges_ down to the\r\n",
      "death of _Sampson_, and therefore was compiled after his death, out of the\r\n",
      "Acts of the _Judges_. Several things in this book are said to be done _when\r\n",
      "there was no King in _Israel__, _Judg._ xvii. 6. xviii. 1. xix. 1. xxi. 25.\r\n",
      "and therefore this book was written after the beginning of the reign of\r\n",
      "_Saul_. When it was written, the _Jebusites_ dwelt in _Jerusalem_, _Jud._\r\n",
      "i. 21 and therefore it was written before the eighth year of _David_, 2\r\n",
      "_Sam._ v. 8. and 1 _Chron._ xi. 6. The books of _Moses_, _Joshua_, and\r\n",
      "_Judges_, contain one continued history, down from the Creation to the\r\n",
      "death of _Sampson_. Where the _Pentateuch_ ends, the book of _Joshua_\r\n",
      "begins; and where the book of _Joshua_ ends, the book of _Judges_ begins.\r\n",
      "Therefore all these books have been composed out of the writings of\r\n",
      "_Moses_, _Joshua_, and other records, by one and the same hand, after the\r\n",
      "beginning of the reign of _Saul_, and before the eighth year of _David_.\r\n",
      "And _Samuel_ was a sacred writer, 1 _Sam._ x. 25. acquainted with the\r\n",
      "history of _Moses_ and the _Judges_, 1 _Sam._ xii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and\r\n",
      "had leisure in the reign of _Saul_, and sufficient authority to compose\r\n",
      "these books. He was a Prophet, and judged _Israel_ all the days of his\r\n",
      "life, and was in the greatest esteem with the people; and the Law by which\r\n",
      "he was to judge the people was not to be published by less authority than\r\n",
      "his own, the Law-maker being not inferior to the judge. And the book of\r\n",
      "_Jasher_, which is quoted in the book of _Joshua_, _Josh._ x. 13. was in\r\n",
      "being at the death of _Saul_, 2 _Sam._ i. 18.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the dedication of the Temple of _Solomon_, when the Ark was brought into\r\n",
      "the most holy place, there was nothing in it but the two tables, 1 _Kings_\r\n",
      "viii. 9. and therefore when the _Philistines_ took the Ark, they took out\r\n",
      "of it the book of the Law, and the golden pot of Manna, and _Aaron_'s Rod.\r\n",
      "And this and other losses in the desolation of _Israel_, by the conquering\r\n",
      "_Philistines_, might give occasion to _Samuel_, after some respite from\r\n",
      "those enemies, to recollect the scattered writings of _Moses_ and _Joshua_,\r\n",
      "and the records of the Patriarchs and Judges, and compose them in the form\r\n",
      "now extant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book of _Ruth_ is a history of things done in the days of the _Judges_,\r\n",
      "and may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the _Judges_, written\r\n",
      "by the same author, and at the same time. For it was written after the\r\n",
      "birth of _David_, _Ruth_ iv. 17, 22. and not long after, because the\r\n",
      "history of _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, the great grandfather and great grandmother\r\n",
      "of _David_, and that of their contemporaries, could not well be remembered\r\n",
      "above two or three generations. And since this book derives the genealogy\r\n",
      "of _David_ from _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, and omits _David_'s elder brothers and\r\n",
      "his sons; it was written in honour of _David_, after he was anointed King\r\n",
      "by _Samuel_, and before he had children in _Hebron_, and by consequence in\r\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_. It proceeds not to the history of _David_, and\r\n",
      "therefore seems to have been written presently after he was anointed. They\r\n",
      "judge well therefore who ascribe to _Samuel_ the books of _Joshua_,\r\n",
      "_Judges_, and _Ruth_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_Samuel_ is also reputed the author of the first book of _Samuel_, till the\r\n",
      "time of his death. The two books of _Samuel_ cite no authors, and therefore\r\n",
      "seem to be originals. They begin with his genealogy, birth and education,\r\n",
      "and might be written partly in his lifetime by himself or his disciples the\r\n",
      "Prophets at _Naioth_ in _Ramah_, 1 _Sam._ xix. 18, 19, 20. and partly after\r\n",
      "his death by the same disciples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The books of the _Kings_ cite other authors, as the book of the Acts of\r\n",
      "_Solomon_, the book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Israel_, and the\r\n",
      "book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Judah_. The books of the\r\n",
      "_Chronicles_ cite the book of _Samuel_ the Seer, the book of _Nathan_ the\r\n",
      "Prophet, and the book of _Gad_ the Seer, for the Acts of _David_; the book\r\n",
      "of _Nathan_ the Prophet, the Prophecy of _Ahijah_ the _Shilonite_, and the\r\n",
      "visions of _Iddo_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Solomon_; the book of\r\n",
      "_Shemajah_ the Prophet, and the book of _Iddo_ the Seer concerning\r\n",
      "genealogies, for the Acts of _Rehoboam_ and _Abijah_; the book of the Kings\r\n",
      "of _Judah_ and _Israel_ for the Acts of _Asa_, _Joash_, _Amaziah_,\r\n",
      "_Jotham_, _Ahaz_, _Hezekiah_, _Manasseh_, and _Josiah_; the book of\r\n",
      "_Hanani_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Jehosaphat_; and the visions of\r\n",
      "_Isaiah_ for the Acts of _Uzziah_ and _Hezekiah_. These books were\r\n",
      "therefore collected out of the historical writings of the antient Seers and\r\n",
      "Prophets. And because the books of the _Kings_ and _Chronicles_ quote one\r\n",
      "another, they were written at one and the same time. And this time was\r\n",
      "after the return from the _Babylonian_ captivity, because they bring down\r\n",
      "the history of _Judah_, and the genealogies of the Kings of _Judah_, and of\r\n",
      "the High Priests, to that captivity. The book of _Ezra_ was originally a\r\n",
      "part of the book of the _Chronicles_, and has been divided from it. For it\r\n",
      "begins with the two last verses of the books of _Chronicles_, and the first\r\n",
      "book of _Esdras_ begins with the two last chapters thereof. _Ezra_ was\r\n",
      "therefore the compiler of the books of _Kings_ and _Chronicles_, and\r\n",
      "brought down the history to his own time. He was a ready Scribe in the Law\r\n",

      "Then a new Exarch, _Eutychius_, coming to _Naples_, sent some secretly to\r\n",
      "take away the lives of the Pope and the Nobles of _Rome_: but the plot\r\n",
      "being discovered, the _Romans_ revolted absolutely from the _Greek_\r\n",
      "Emperor, and took an oath to preserve the life of the Pope, to defend his\r\n",
      "state, and be obedient to his authority in all things. Thus _Rome_ with its\r\n",
      "Duchy, including part of _Tuscany_ and part of _Campania_, revolted in the\r\n",
      "year 726, and became a free state under the government of the Senate of\r\n",
      "this city. The authority of the Senate in civil affairs was henceforward\r\n",
      "absolute, the authority of the Pope extending hitherto no farther than to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At that time [6] the _Lombards_ also being zealous for the worship of\r\n",
      "images, and pretending to favour the cause of the Pope, invaded the cities\r\n",
      "of the Exarchate: and at length, viz. A.C. 752, took _Ravenna_, and put an\r\n",
      "end to the Exarchate. And this was the first of the three kingdoms which\r\n",
      "fell before the little horn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the year 751 [7] Pope _Zechary_ deposed _Childeric_, a slothful and\r\n",
      "useless King of _France_, and the last of the race of _Merovæus_; and\r\n",
      "absolving his subjects from their oath of allegiance, gave the kingdom to\r\n",
      "_Pipin_ the major of the Palace; and thereby made a new and potent friend.\r\n",
      "His successor [8] Pope _Stephen_ III, knowing better how to deal with the\r\n",
      "_Greek_ Emperor than with the _Lombards_, went the next year to the King of\r\n",
      "the _Lombards_, to persuade him to return the Exarchate to the Emperor. But\r\n",
      "this not succeeding, he went into _France_, and persuaded _Pipin_ to take\r\n",
      "the Exarchate and _Pentapolis_ from the _Lombards_, and give it to St.\r\n",
      "_Peter_. Accordingly _Pipin_ A.C. 754 came with an army into _Italy_, and\r\n",
      "made _Aistulphus_ King of the _Lombards_ promise the surrender: but the\r\n",
      "next year _Aistulphus_, on the contrary, to revenge himself on the Pope,\r\n",
      "besieged the city of _Rome_. Whereupon the Pope sent letters to _Pipin_,\r\n",

      "_pro data sibi potentia, alienandum fore à regno Dei & vita æterna_, he\r\n",
      "should be excommunicated. _Pipin_ therefore, fearing a revolt of his\r\n",
      "subjects, and being indebted to the Church of _Rome_, came speedily with an\r\n",
      "army into _Italy_, raised the siege, besieged the _Lombards_ in _Pavia_,\r\n",
      "and forced them to surrender the Exarchate and region of _Pentapolis_ to\r\n",
      "the Pope for a perpetual possession. Thus the Pope became Lord of\r\n",
      "_Ravenna_, and the Exarchate, some few cities excepted; and the keys were\r\n",
      "sent to _Rome_, and laid upon the confession of St. _Peter_, that is, upon\r\n",
      "his tomb at the high Altar, _in signum veri perpetuique dominii, sed\r\n",
      "pietate Regis gratuita_, as the inscription of a coin of _Pipin_ hath it.\r\n",
      "This was in the year of Christ 755. And henceforward the Popes being\r\n",
      "temporal Princes, left off in their Epistles and Bulls to note the years of\r\n",
      "the _Greek_ Emperors, as they had hitherto done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this [9] the _Lombards_ invading the Pope's countries, Pope _Adrian_\r\n",
      "sent to _Charles_ the great, the son and successor of _Pipin_, to come to\r\n",

      "the _Lombards_, overthrew their kingdom, became master of their countries,\r\n",
      "and restored to the Pope, not only what they had taken from him, but also\r\n",
      "the rest of the Exarchate which they had promised _Pipin_ to surrender to\r\n",
      "him, but had hitherto detained; and also gave him some cities of the\r\n",

      "had the authority of confirming the elections of the Popes conferred upon\r\n",
      "him. These things were done in the years 773 and 774. This kingdom of the\r\n",
      "_Lombards_ was the second kingdom which fell before the little horn. But\r\n",
      "_Rome_, which was to be the seat of his kingdom, was not yet his own.\r\n",

      "In the year 796, [10] _Leo_ III being made Pope, notified his election to\r\n",

      "signification that _Charles_ should come and subdue the Senate and people\r\n",
      "of _Rome_, as he had done the Exarchate and the kingdom of the _Lombards_.\r\n",

      "_Romans_ about two or three years after, by assistance of some of the\r\n",
      "Clergy, raised such tumults against him, as gave occasion to a new state of\r\n",

      "the _Romans_ with an armed force, seized him, stript him of his sacerdotal\r\n",
      "habit, and imprisoned him in a monastery. But by assistance of his friends\r\n",
      "he made his escape, and fled into _Germany_ to _Charles_ the great, to whom\r\n",
      "he complained of the _Romans_ for acting against him out of a design to\r\n",
      "throw off all authority of the Church, and to recover their antient\r\n",
      "freedom. In his absence his accusers with their forces ravaged the\r\n",
      "possessions of the Church, and sent the accusations to _Charles_; who\r\n",
      "before the end of the year sent the Pope back to _Rome_ with a large\r\n",
      "retinue. The Nobles and Bishops of _France_ who accompanied him, examined\r\n",
      "the chief of his accusers at _Rome_, and sent them into _France_ in\r\n",
      "custody. This was in the year 799. The next year _Charles_ himself went to\r\n",
      "_Rome_, and upon a day appointed presided in a Council of _Italian_ and\r\n",
      "_French_ Bishops to hear both parties. But when the Pope's adversaries\r\n",
      "expected to be heard, the Council declared [11] that he who was the supreme\r\n",
      "judge of all men, was above being judged by any other than himself:\r\n",

      "Emperor, and subjected themselves to him in such manner as the old _Roman_\r\n",
      "Empire and their Senate were subjected to the old _Roman_ Emperors. The\r\n",
      "Pope crowned him, and anointed him with holy oil, and worshipped him on his\r\n",
      "knees after the manner of adoring the old _Roman_ Emperors; as the\r\n",

      "  _Principibus fuit antiquis_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Emperor, on the other hand, took the following oath to the Pope: _In\r\n",

      "beato Petro Apostolo, me protectorem ac defensorem fore hujus sanctæ Romanæ\r\n",
      "Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus, quatenùs divino fultus fuero adjutorio,\r\n",
      "prout sciero poteroque_. The Emperor was also made Consul of _Rome_, and\r\n",
      "his son _Pipin_ crowned King of _Italy_: and henceforward the Emperor\r\n",
      "stiled himself: _Carolus serenissimus, Augustus, à Deo coronatus, magnus,\r\n",
      "pacificus, Romæ gubernans imperium_, or _Imperator Romanorum_; and was\r\n",
      "prayed for in the Churches of _Rome_. His image was henceforward put upon\r\n",
      "the coins of _Rome_: while the enemies of the Pope, to the number of three\r\n",
      "hundred _Romans_ and two or three of the Clergy, were sentenced to death.\r\n",
      "The three hundred _Romans_ were beheaded in one day in the _Lateran_\r\n",
      "fields: but the Clergymen at the intercession of the Pope were pardoned,\r\n",
      "and banished into _France_. And thus the title of _Roman_ Emperor, which\r\n",
      "had hitherto been in the _Greek_ Emperors, was by this act transferred in\r\n",
      "the _West_ to the Kings of _France_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After these things [12] _Charles_ gave the City and Duchy of _Rome_ to the\r\n",

      "in ordering the affairs of _Rome_, and those of the Apostolic see, and of\r\n",
      "all _Italy_, both civil and ecclesiastical, and in making new laws for\r\n",
      "them; and returned the next summer into _France_: leaving the city under\r\n",
      "its Senate, and both under the Pope and himself. But hearing that his new\r\n",
      "laws were not observed by the judges in dictating the law, nor by the\r\n",
      "people in hearing it; and that the great men took servants from free men,\r\n",
      "and from the Churches and Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards,\r\n",
      "fields, pastures and houses, and continued to exact cattle and wine of\r\n",
      "them, and to oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son\r\n",

      "Now the Senate and people and principality of _Rome_ I take to be the third\r\n",

      "people elected the Pope and the Emperor; and now, by electing the Emperor\r\n",
      "and making him Consul, was acknowledged to retain the authority of the old\r\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate and people. This city was the Metropolis of the old _Roman_\r\n",
      "Empire, represented in _Daniel_ by the fourth Beast; and by subduing the\r\n",
      "Senate and people and Duchy, it became the Metropolis of the little horn of\r\n",
      "that Beast, and completed _Peter_'s Patrimony, which was the kingdom of\r\n",
      "that horn. Besides, this victory was attended with greater consequences\r\n",
      "than those over the other two Kings. For it set up the _Western Empire_,\r\n",
      "which continues to this day. It set up the Pope above the judicature of the\r\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate, and above that of a Council of _Italian_ and _French_\r\n",
      "Bishops, and even above all human judicature; and gave him the supremacy\r\n",
      "over the _Western_ Churches and their Councils in a high degree. It gave\r\n",
      "him _a look more stout than his fellows_; so that when this new religion\r\n",
      "began to be established in the minds of men, he grappled not only with\r\n",
      "Kings, but even with the _Western_ Emperor himself. It is observable also,\r\n",
      "that the custom of kissing the Pope's feet, an honour superior to that of\r\n",
      "Kings and Emperors, began about this time. There are some instances of it\r\n",
      "in the ninth century: _Platina_ tells us, that the feet of Pope _Leo_ IV\r\n",
      "were kissed, according to antient custom, by all who came to him: and some\r\n",
      "say that _Leo_ III began this custom, pretending that his hand was infected\r\n",
      "by the kiss of a woman. The Popes began also about this time to canonize\r\n",
      "saints, and to grant indulgences and pardons: and some represent that _Leo_\r\n",
      "III was the first author of all these things. It is further observable,\r\n",
      "that _Charles_ the great, between the years 775 and 796, conquered all\r\n",
      "_Germany_ from the _Rhine_ and _Danube_ northward to the _Baltic_ sea, and\r\n",
      "eastward to the river _Teis_; extending his conquests also into _Spain_ as\r\n",
      "far as the river _Ebro_: and by these conquests he laid the foundation of\r\n",
      "the new Empire; and at the same time propagated the _Roman_ Catholic\r\n",
      "religion into all his conquests, obliging the _Saxons_ and _Hunns_ who were\r\n",
      "heathens, to receive the _Roman_ faith, and distributing his northern\r\n",
      "conquests into Bishopricks, granting tithes to the Clergy and _Peter-pence_\r\n",
      "to the Pope: by all which the Church of _Rome_ was highly enlarged,\r\n",
      "enriched, exalted, and established.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the forementioned _dissertation upon some coins of _Charles_ the great,\r\n",
      "_Ludovicus Pius_, _Lotharius_, and their successors, stamped at _Rome__,\r\n",
      "there is a draught of a piece of _Mosaic_ work which Pope _Leo_ III. caused\r\n",
      "to be made in his Palace near the Church of _John Lateran_, in memory of\r\n",
      "his sending the standard or banner of the city of _Rome_ curiously wrought,\r\n",
      "to _Charles_ the great; and which still remained there at the publishing of\r\n",
      "the said book. In the _Mosaic_ work there appeared _Peter_ with three keys\r\n",
      "in his lap, reaching the _Pallium_ to the Pope with his right hand, and the\r\n",
      "banner of the city to _Charles_ the great with his left. By the Pope was\r\n",
      "this inscription, SCISSIMUS D.N. LEO PP; by the King this, D.N. CARVLO\r\n",
      "REGI; and under the feet of _Peter_ this, BEATE PETRE, DONA VITAM LEONI PP,\r\n",
      "ET BICTORIAM CARVLO REGI DONA. This Monument gives the title of King to\r\n",
      "_Charles_, and therefore was erected before he was Emperor. It was erected\r\n",
      "when _Peter_ was reaching the _Pallium_ to the Pope, and the Pope was\r\n",
      "sending the banner of the city to _Charles_, that is, A.C. 796. The words\r\n",
      "above, _Sanctissimus Dominus noster Leo Papa Domino nostro Carolo Regi_,\r\n",
      "relate to the message; and the words below, _Beate Petre, dona vitam Leoni\r\n",
      "Papæ & victoriam Carolo regi dona_, are a prayer that in this undertaking\r\n",
      "God would preserve the life of the Pope, and give victory to the King over\r\n",
      "the _Romans_. The three keys in the lap of _Peter_ signify the keys of the\r\n",
      "three parts of his Patrimony, that of _Rome_ with its Duchy, which the Pope\r\n",
      "claimed and was conquering, those of _Ravenna_ with the Exarchate, and of\r\n",
      "the territories taken from the _Lombards_; both which he had newly\r\n",
      "conquered. These were the three dominions, whose keys were in the lap of\r\n",
      "St. _Peter_, and whose Crowns are now worn by the Pope, and by the conquest\r\n",
      "of which he became the little horn of the fourth Beast. By _Peter_'s giving\r\n",
      "the _Pallium_ to the Pope with his right hand, and the banner of the city\r\n",
      "to the King with his left, and by naming the Pope before the King in the\r\n",

      "persons but two kingdoms, the kingdoms of _Media_ and _Persia_; and the\r\n",

      "these conquests the little horn [5] _waxed exceeding great towards the\r\n",

      "reign of _Constantine_ the great and his sons: and then by the division of\r\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire between the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Emperors, it separated\r\n",
      "from the _Latins_, and became the _Greek_ Empire alone, but yet under the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This last horn is by some taken for _Antiochus Epiphanes_, but not very\r\n",
      "judiciously. A horn of a Beast is never taken for a single person: it\r\n",
      "always signifies a new kingdom, and the kingdom of _Antiochus_ was an old\r\n",
      "one. _Antiochus_ reigned over one of the four horns, and the little horn\r\n",
      "was a fifth under its proper kings. This horn was at first a little one,\r\n",
      "and waxed exceeding great, but so did not _Antiochus_. It is described\r\n",
      "great above all the former horns, and so was not _Antiochus_. His kingdom\r\n",
      "on the contrary was weak, and tributary to the _Romans_, and he did not\r\n",
      "enlarge it. The horn was a _King of fierce countenance, and destroyed\r\n",
      "wonderfully, and prospered and practised_; that is, he prospered in his\r\n",
      "practises against the holy people: but _Antiochus_ was frighted out of\r\n",
      "_Egypt_ by a mere message of the _Romans_, and afterwards routed and\r\n",
      "baffled by the _Jews_. The horn was mighty by another's power, _Antiochus_\r\n",
      "acted by his own. The horn stood up against the Prince of the Host of\r\n",
      "heaven, the Prince of Princes; and this is the character not of _Antiochus_\r\n",
      "but of _Antichrist_. The horn cast down the Sanctuary to the ground, and so\r\n",
      "did not _Antiochus_; he left it standing. The Sanctuary and Host were\r\n",
      "trampled under foot 2300 days; and in _Daniel_'s Prophecies days are put\r\n",
      "for years: but the profanation of the Temple in the reign of _Antiochus_\r\n",
      "did not last so many natural days. These were to last till the time of the\r\n",
      "end, till the last end of the indignation against the _Jews_; and this\r\n",
      "indignation is not yet at an end. They were to last till the Sanctuary\r\n",
      "which had been cast down should be cleansed, and the Sanctuary is not yet\r\n",
      "cleansed.\r\n",

      "This Prophecy of the Ram and He-Goat is repeated in the last Prophecy of\r\n",
      "_Daniel_. There the Angel tells _Daniel_, that [9] _he stood up to\r\n",
      "strengthen _Darius_ the _Mede_, and that there should stand up yet three\r\n",
      "kings in _Persia__, [_Cyrus_, _Cambyses_, and _Darius Hystaspis_] _and the\r\n",

      "relates to the Ram, whose two horns were the kingdoms of _Media_ and\r\n",
      "_Persia_. Then he goes on to describe the horns of the Goat by the [10]\r\n",
      "_standing up of a mighty king, which should rule with great dominion, and\r\n",
      "do according to his will_; and by the breaking of his kingdom into four\r\n",
      "smaller kingdoms, and not descending to his own posterity. Then he\r\n",
      "describes the actions of two of those kingdoms which bordered on _Judea_,\r\n",
      "_viz_. _Egypt_ and _Syria_, calling them the Kings of the _South_ and\r\n",
      "_North_, that is, in respect of _Judea_; and he carries on the description\r\n",
      "till the latter end of the kingdoms of the four, and till the reign of\r\n",
      "_Antiochus Epiphanes_, when transgressors were come to the full. In the\r\n",

      "of the kings of the _South_ and _North_, and begins to describe those of\r\n",

      "after him Arms_ [the _Romans_] _shall stand up, and they shall pollute the\r\n",
      "sanctuary of strength_. As [Hebrew: MMLK] signifies _after the king_, Dan.\r\n",
      "xi. 8; so here [Hebrew: MMNW] may signify _after him_: and so [Hebrew:\r\n",

      "where in these Prophecies of _Daniel_ put for the military power of a\r\n",
      "kingdom, and they stand up when they conquer and grow powerful. The\r\n",
      "_Romans_ conquered _Illyricum_, _Epirus_ and _Macedonia_, in the year of\r\n",
      "_Nabonassar_ 580; and thirty five years after, by the last will and\r\n",

      "_Syria_, and reduced it into a Province: and thirty four years after they\r\n",
      "did the like to _Egypt_. By all these steps the _Roman_ arms stood up over\r\n",
      "the _Greeks_. And after 95 years more, by making war upon the _Jews, they\r\n",
      "polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took away the daily sacrifice,\r\n",

      "_Matth._ xxiv. 15. In the 16th year of the Emperor _Hadrian_, A. C. 132,\r\n",
      "they placed this abomination by building a Temple to _Jupiter Capitolinus_,\r\n",
      "where the Temple of God in _Jerusalem_ had stood. Thereupon the _Jews_\r\n",
      "under the conduct of _Barchochab_ rose up in arms against the _Romans_, and\r\n",
      "in that war had 50 cities demolished, 985 of their best towns destroyed,\r\n",
      "and 580000 men slain by the sword: and in the end of the war, A.C. 136,\r\n",

      "_Of the King who did according to his will, and magnified himself above\r\n",
      "every God, and honoured _Mahuzzims_, and regarded not the desire of women_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first ages of the Christian religion the Christians of every city\r\n",
      "were governed by a Council of Presbyters, and the President of the Council\r\n",
      "was the Bishop of the city. The Bishop and Presbyters of one city meddled\r\n",
      "not with the affairs of another city, except by admonitory letters or\r\n",
      "messages. Nor did the Bishops of several cities meet together in Council\r\n",
      "before the time of the Emperor _Commodus_: for they could not meet together\r\n",
      "without the leave of the _Roman_ governors of the Provinces. But in the\r\n",
      "days of that Emperor they began to meet in Provincial Councils, by the\r\n",
      "leave of the governors; first in _Asia_, in opposition to the\r\n",
      "_Cataphrygian_ Heresy, and soon after in other places and upon other\r\n",
      "occasions. The Bishop of the chief city, or Metropolis of the _Roman_\r\n",
      "Province, was usually made President of the Council; and hence came the\r\n",
      "authority of Metropolitan Bishops above that of other Bishops within the\r\n",
      "same Province. Hence also it was that the Bishop of _Rome_ in _Cyprian_'s\r\n",
      "days called himself the Bishop of Bishops. As soon as the Empire became\r\n",
      "Christian, the _Roman_ Emperors began to call general Councils out of all\r\n",
      "the Provinces of the Empire; and by prescribing to them what points they\r\n",
      "should consider, and influencing them by their interest and power, they set\r\n",
      "up what party they pleased. Hereby the _Greek_ Empire, upon the division of\r\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, became _the King\r\n",
      "who_, in matters of religion, _did according to his will_; _and_, in\r\n",
      "legislature, _exalted and magnified himself above every God_: and at\r\n",

      "In scripture we are told of some _trusting in God_ and others _trusting in\r\n",
      "idols_, and that _God is our refuge, our strength, our defense_. In this\r\n",
      "sense God is _the rock of his people_, and false Gods are called _the rock\r\n",

      "same sense the Gods of _the King_ who _shall do according to his will_ are\r\n",

      "Now this came to pass by degrees in the following manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_Gregory Nyssen_ [2] tells us, that after the persecution of the Emperor\r\n",
      "_Decius_, _Gregory_ Bishop of _Neocæsarea_ in _Pontus_, _instituted among\r\n",
      "all people, as an addition or corollary of devotion towards God, that\r\n",
      "festival days and assemblies should be celebrated to them who had contended\r\n",
      "for the faith_, that is, to the _Martyrs_. And he adds this reason for the\r\n",
      "institution: _When he observed_, saith _Nyssen_, _that the simple and\r\n",
      "unskilful multitude, by reason of corporeal delights, remained in the error\r\n",
      "of idols; that the principal thing might be corrected among them, namely,\r\n",
      "that instead of their vain worship they might turn their eyes upon God; he\r\n",
      "permitted that at the memories of the holy Martyrs they might make merry\r\n",
      "and delight themselves, and be dissolved into joy_. The heathens were\r\n",
      "delighted with the festivals of their Gods, and unwilling to part with\r\n",
      "those delights; and therefore _Gregory_, to facilitate their conversion,\r\n",
      "instituted annual festivals to the _Saints_ and _Martyrs_. Hence it came to\r\n",
      "pass, that for exploding the festivals of the heathens, the principal\r\n",
      "festivals of the _Christians_ succeeded in their room: as the keeping of\r\n",
      "_Christmas_ with ivy and feasting, and playing and sports, in the room of\r\n",
      "the _Bacchanalia_ and _Saturnalia_; the celebrating of _May-day_ with\r\n",
      "flowers, in the room of the _Floralia_; and the keeping of festivals to the\r\n",
      "Virgin _Mary_, _John_ the Baptist, and divers of the Apostles, in the room\r\n",
      "of the solemnities at the entrance of the Sun into the signs of the\r\n",
      "_Zodiac_ in the old _Julian_ Calendar. In the same persecution of _Decius_,\r\n",
      "_Cyprian_ ordered the passions of the Martyrs in _Africa_ to be registred,\r\n",
      "in order to celebrate their memories annually with oblations and\r\n",
      "sacrifices: and _Felix_ Bishop of _Rome_, a little after, as _Platina_\r\n",

      "eorum nomine celebrarentur_; \"consulting the glory of the Martyrs, ordained\r\n",
      "that sacrifices should be celebrated annually in their name.\" By the\r\n",
      "pleasures of these festivals the _Christians_ increased much in number, and\r\n",
      "decreased as much in virtue, until they were _purged and made white_ by the\r\n",
      "persecution of _Dioclesian_. This was the first step made in the\r\n",
      "_Christian_ religion towards the veneration of the Martyrs: and tho it did\r\n",
      "not yet amount to an unlawful worship; yet it disposed the _Christians_\r\n",

      "the invocation of Saints.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres of the Martyrs:\r\n",
      "which practice began in _Dioclesian_'s persecution. The Council of\r\n",
      "_Eliberis_ in _Spain_, celebrated in the third or fourth year of\r\n",

      "the Council of _Laodicea_ in _Phrygia_, which then met for restoring the\r\n",
      "lapsed discipline of the Church, has the following Canons. Can. 9. _Those\r\n",
      "of the Church are not allowed to go into the _Coemeteries_ or _Martyries_,\r\n",
      "as they are called, of hereticks, for the sake of prayer or recovery of\r\n",
      "health: but such as go, if they be of the faithful, shall be excommunicated\r\n",
      "for a time_. Can. 34. _A _Christian_ must not leave the Martyrs of\r\n",
      "_Christ_, and go to false Martyrs_, that is, to the Martyrs of the\r\n",
      "hereticks; _for these are alien from God: and therefore let those be\r\n",
      "anathema who go to them_. Can. 51. _The birth-days of the Martyrs shall not\r\n",
      "be celebrated in _Lent_, but their commemoration shall be made on the\r\n",
      "Sabbath-days and Lords days_. The Council of _Paphlagonia_, celebrated in\r\n",
      "the year 324, made this Canon: _If any man being arrogant, abominates the\r\n",
      "congregations of the Martyrs, or the Liturgies performed therein, or the\r\n",
      "memories of the Martyrs, let him be anathema_. By all which it is manifest\r\n",
      "that the _Christians_ in the time of _Dioclesian_'s persecution used to\r\n",
      "pray in the _Coemeteries_ or burying-places of the dead; for avoiding the\r\n",
      "danger of the persecution, and for want of Churches, which were all thrown\r\n",
      "down: and after the persecution was over, continued that practice in honour\r\n",
      "of the Martyrs, till new Churches could be built: and by use affected it as\r\n",
      "advantageous to devotion, and for recovering the health of those that were\r\n",
      "sick. It also appears that in these burying-places they commemorated the\r\n",
      "Martyrs yearly upon days dedicated to them, and accounted all these\r\n",
      "practices pious and religious, and anathematized those men as arrogant who\r\n",
      "opposed them, or prayed in the _Martyries_ of the hereticks. They also\r\n",
      "lighted torches to the Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens did to\r\n",
      "their Gods; which custom, before the end of the fourth century, prevailed\r\n",
      "much in the _West_. They sprinkled the worshipers of the Martyrs with\r\n",
      "holy-water, as the heathens did the worshipers of their Gods; and went in\r\n",
      "pilgrimage to see _Jerusalem_ and other holy places, as if those places\r\n",
      "conferred sanctity on the visiters. From the custom of praying in the\r\n",
      "_Coemeteries_ and _Martyries_, came the custom of translating the bodies of\r\n",
      "the Saints and Martyrs into such Churches as were new built: the Emperor\r\n",
      "_Constantius_ began this practice about the year 359, causing the bodies of\r\n",
      "_Andrew_ the Apostle, _Luke_ and _Timothy_, to be translated into a new\r\n",
      "Church at _Constantinople_: and before this act of _Constantius_, the\r\n",
      "_Egyptians_ kept the bodies of their Martyrs and Saints unburied upon beds\r\n",
      "in their private houses, and told stories of their souls appearing after\r\n",
      "death and ascending up to heaven, as _Athanasius_ relates in the life of\r\n",
      "_Antony_. All which gave occasion to the Emperor _Julian_, as _Cyril_\r\n",
      "relates, to accuse the _Christians_ in this manner: _Your adding to that\r\n",
      "antient dead man, Jesus, many new dead men, who can sufficiently abominate?\r\n",
      "You have filled all places with sepulchres and monuments, altho you are no\r\n",
      "where bidden to prostrate yourselves to sepulchres, and to respect them\r\n",
      "officiously._ And a little after: _Since _Jesus_ said that sepulchres are\r\n",
      "full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them_? and in another place\r\n",
      "he saith, that if _Christians_ had adhered to the precepts of the\r\n",
      "_Hebrews_, _they would have worshiped one God instead of many, and not a\r\n",
      "man, or rather not many unhappy men_: And that they _adored the wood of the\r\n",
      "cross, making its images on their foreheads, and before their houses_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs were thus converted into places\r\n",
      "of worship like the heathen temples, and the Churches into sepulchres, and\r\n",
      "a certain sort of sanctity attributed to the dead bodies of the Saints and\r\n",
      "Martyrs buried in them, and annual festivals were kept to them, with\r\n",
      "sacrifices offered to God in their name; the next step towards the\r\n",
      "invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead bodies, bones and\r\n",
      "other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means of the separate\r\n",
      "souls, who were supposed to know what we do or say, and to be able to do us\r\n",
      "good or hurt, and to work those miracles. This was the very notion the\r\n",
      "heathens had of the separate souls of their antient Kings and Heroes, whom\r\n",
      "they worshiped under the names of _Saturn_, _Rhea_, _Jupiter_, _Juno_,\r\n",
      "_Mars_, _Venus_, _Bacchus_, _Ceres_, _Osiris_, _Isis_, _Apollo_, _Diana_,\r\n",
      "and the rest of their Gods. For these Gods being male and female, husband\r\n",
      "and wife, son and daughter, brother and sister, are thereby discovered to\r\n",

      "same Emperor demolish the sepulchre of _John_ the Baptist in _Phoenicia_,\r\n",
      "and burn his bones; when several _Christians_ mixing themselves with the\r\n",
      "heathens, gathered up some of his remains, which were sent to _Athanasius_,\r\n",
      "who hid them in the wall of a Church; foreseeing by a prophetic spirit, as\r\n",
      "_Ruffinus_ tells us, that they might be profitable to future generations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cry of these miracles being once set on foot, continued for many years,\r\n",
      "and encreased and grew more general. _Chrysostom_, in his second Oration on\r\n",
      "St. _Babylas_, twenty years after the silencing of the Oracle of _Apollo\r\n",
      "Daphnæus_ as above, viz. A.C. 382, saith of the miracles done by the Saints\r\n",

      "reliques of Saints and Martyrs, the _Egyptians_ keeping them embalmed upon\r\n",
      "beds even in their private houses; and _Alexandria_ was eminent above all\r\n",
      "other cities for dispersing them, so as on that account to acquire glory\r\n",
      "with all men, and manifest herself to be the _Metropolis_ of the world.\r\n",
      "_Antioch_ followed the example of _Egypt_, in dispersing the reliques of\r\n",
      "the forty Martyrs: and the examples of _Egypt_ and _Syria_ were soon\r\n",
      "followed by the rest of the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reliques of the forty Martyrs at _Antioch_ were distributed among the\r\n",
      "Churches before the year 373; for _Athanasius_ who died in that year, wrote\r\n",
      "an Oration upon them. This Oration is not yet published, but _Gerard\r\n",
      "Vossius_ saw it in MS. in the Library of Cardinal _Ascanius_ in _Italy_, as\r\n",
      "he says in his commentary upon the Oration of _Ephræm Syrus_ on the same\r\n",
      "forty Martyrs. Now since the Monks of _Alexandria_ sent the reliques of the\r\n",
      "Martyrs of _Egypt_ into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory\r\n",
      "to their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the\r\n",
      "whole world, as we have observed out of _Chrysostom_; it may be concluded,\r\n",
      "that before _Alexandria_ received the forty Martyrs from _Antioch_, she\r\n",
      "began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs into all parts, setting\r\n",
      "the first example to other cities. This practice therefore began in _Egypt_\r\n",
      "some years before the death of _Athanasius_. It began when the\r\n",
      "miracle-working bones of _John_ the Baptist were carried into _Egypt_, and\r\n",
      "hid in the wall of a Church, _that they might be profitable to future\r\n",
      "generations_. It was restrained in the reign of _Julian_ the Apostate: and\r\n",
      "then it spred from _Egypt_ into all the Empire, _Alexandria_ being the\r\n",
      "Metropolis of the whole world, according to _Chrysostom_, for propagating\r\n",
      "this sort of devotion, and _Antioch_ and other cities soon following her\r\n",
      "example.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In propagating these superstitions, the ring-leaders were the Monks, and\r\n",
      "_Antony_ was at the head of them: for in the end of the life of _Antony_,\r\n",
      "_Athanasius_ relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who\r\n",
      "then attended him. _Do you take care_, said _Antony_, _to adhere to\r\n",
      "_Christ_ in the first place, and then to the Saints, that after death they\r\n",
      "may receive you as friends and acquaintance into the everlasting\r\n",
      "tabernacles, Think upon these things, perceive these things; and if you\r\n",
      "have any regard to me, remember me as a father_. This being delivered in\r\n",
      "charge to the Monks by _Antony_ at his death, A.C. 356, could not but\r\n",
      "inflame their whole body with devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way\r\n",
      "to be received, by them into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence\r\n",
      "came that noise about the miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in\r\n",
      "the time of _Constantius_: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working\r\n",
      "reliques into all the Empire; _Alexandria_ setting the example, and being\r\n",
      "renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in the days\r\n",
      "of _Julian_, A.C. 362, that _Athanasius_ by a prophetic spirit, as\r\n",
      "_Ruffinus_ tells us, hid the bones of _John_ the Baptist from the Heathens,\r\n",
      "not in the ground to be forgotten, but in the hollow wall of a Church\r\n",
      "before proper witnesses, that they might _be profitable to future\r\n",
      "generations_. Hence also came the invocation of the Saints for doing such\r\n",
      "miracles, and for assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God.\r\n",
      "For _Athanasius_, even from his youth, looked upon the dead Saints and\r\n",
      "Martyrs as mediators of our prayers: in his Epistle to _Marcellinus_,\r\n",
      "written in the days of _Constantine_ the great, he saith that the words of\r\n",
      "the _Psalms_ are not to be transposed or any wise changed, but to be\r\n",
      "recited and sung without any artifice, as they are written, _that the holy\r\n",
      "men who delivered them, knowing them to be their own words, may pray with\r\n",
      "us; or rather, that the Holy Ghost who spake in the holy men, seeing his\r\n",
      "own words with which he inspired them, may join_ with them _in assisting\r\n",
      "us_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst _Egypt_ abounded with Monks above any other country, the veneration\r\n",
      "of the Saints began sooner, and spred faster there than in other places.\r\n",
      "_Palladius_ going into _Egypt_ in the year 388 to visit the Monasteries,\r\n",
      "and the sepulchres of _Apollonius_ and other Martyrs of _Thebais_ who had\r\n",
      "suffered under _Maximinus_, saith of them: _Iis omnibus Christiani fecerunt\r\n",

      "beyond the bounds of mere oratorical flourishes, and that the common people\r\n",

      "waged or suffered_: and in his Oration upon _Cyprian_, not the Bishop of\r\n",
      "_Carthage_, but a _Greek_, he invokes him after the same manner; and tells\r\n",

      "nations; but upon invoking _Ephræm_ by name, and saying, _Holy _Ephræm_\r\n",
      "assist me_, he escaped the danger, neglected the fear of death, and beyond\r\n",

      "written A.C. 381, thus describes the power of that Martyr, and the practice\r\n",
      "of the people. _This Martyr_, saith he, _the last year quieted the\r\n",

      "tomb is covered, wherein the body of the Martyr rests; the dust is accepted\r\n",
      "as a gift, and gathered to be laid up as a thing of great price. For to\r\n",
      "touch the reliques themselves, if any such prosperous fortune shall at any\r\n",
      "time happen; how great a favour that is, and not to be obtained without the\r\n",
      "most earnest prayers, they know well who have obtained it. For as a living\r\n",
      "and florid body, they who behold it embrace it, applying to it the eyes,\r\n",
      "mouth, ears, and all the organs of sense; and then with affection pouring\r\n",
      "tears upon the Martyr, as if he was whole and appeared to them: they offer\r\n",

      "praying to him as an Officer attending upon God, and invoking him as\r\n",
      "receiving gifts whenever he will._ At length _Gregory_ concludes the\r\n",
      "Oration with this prayer: _O Theodorus, we want many blessings; intercede\r\n",
      "and beseech for thy country before the common King and Lord: for the\r\n",

      "_Irenæus_ introduced an opinion that the _Apocalypse_ was written in the\r\n",
      "time of _Domitian_; but then he also postponed the writing of some others\r\n",
      "of the sacred books, and was to place the _Apocalypse_ after them: he might\r\n",
      "perhaps have heard from his master _Polycarp_ that he had received this\r\n",
      "book from _John_ about the time of _Domitian_'s death; or indeed _John_\r\n",
      "might himself at that time have made a new publication of it, from whence\r\n",
      "_Irenæus_ might imagine it was then but newly written. _Eusebius_ in his\r\n",
      "_Chronicle_ and _Ecclesiastical History_ follows _Irenoeus_; but afterwards\r\n",
      "[1] in his _Evangelical Demonstrations_, he conjoins the banishment of\r\n",
      "_John_ into _Patmos_, with the deaths of _Peter_ and _Paul_: and so do [2]\r\n",
      "_Tertullian_ and _Pseudo-Prochorus_, as well as the first author, whoever\r\n",
      "he was, of that very antient fable, that _John_ was put by _Nero_ into a\r\n",
      "vessel of hot oil, and coming out unhurt, was banished by him into\r\n",
      "_Patmos._ Tho this story be no more than a fiction yet was it founded on a\r\n",
      "tradition of the first churches, that _John_ was banished into _Patmos_ in\r\n",
      "the days of _Nero_. _Epiphanius_ represents the _Gospel of John_ as written\r\n",
      "in the time of _Domitian_, and the _Apocalypse_ even before that of _Nero_.\r\n",
      "[3] _Arethas_ in the beginning of his Commentary quotes the opinion of\r\n",
      "_Irenæus_ from _Eusebius_, but follows it not: for he afterwards affirms\r\n",
      "the _Apocalypse_ was written before the destruction of _Jerusalem_, and\r\n",
      "that former commentators had expounded the sixth seal of that destruction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the opinion of the first Commentators agrees the tradition of the\r\n",
      "Churches of _Syria_, preserved to this day in the title of the _Syriac_\r\n",
      "Version of the _Apocalypse_, which title is this: _The Revelation which was\r\n",
      "made to _John_ the Evangelist by God in the Island _Patmos_, into which he\r\n",
      "was banished by _Nero_ the _Cæsar__. The fame is confirmed by a story told\r\n",
      "by [4] _Eusebius_ out of _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and other antient authors,\r\n",
      "concerning a youth, whom _John_ some time after his return from _Patmos_\r\n",
      "committed to the care of the Bishop of a certain city. The Bishop educated,\r\n",
      "instructed, and at length baptized him; but then remitting of his care, the\r\n",
      "young man thereupon got into ill company, and began by degrees first to\r\n",
      "revel and grow vitious, then to abuse and spoil those he met in the night;\r\n",
      "and at last grew so desperate, that his companions turning a band of\r\n",
      "high-way men, made him their Captain: and, saith [5] _Chrysostom_, he\r\n",
      "continued their Captain a long time. At length _John_ returning to that\r\n",
      "city, and hearing what was done, rode to the thief; and, when he out of\r\n",
      "reverence to his old master fled, _John_ rode after him, recalled him, and\r\n",
      "restored him to the Church. This is a story of many years, and requires\r\n",
      "that _John_ should have returned from _Patmos_ rather at the death of\r\n",
      "_Nero_ than at that of _Domitian_; because between the death of _Domitian_\r\n",
      "and that of _John_ there were but two years and an half; and _John_ in his\r\n",
      "old age was [6] so infirm as to be carried to Church, dying above 90 years\r\n",
      "old, and therefore could not be then suppos'd able to ride after the thief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This opinion is further supported by the allusions in the _Apocalypse_ to\r\n",
      "the Temple and Altar, and holy City, as then standing; and to the\r\n",
      "_Gentiles_, who were soon after to tread under foot the holy City and\r\n",
      "outward Court. 'Tis confirmed also by the style of the _Apocalypse_ itself,\r\n",
      "which is fuller of _Hebraisms_ than his Gospel. For thence it may be\r\n",
      "gathered, that it was written when _John_ was newly come out of _Judea_,\r\n",
      "where he had been used to the _Syriac_ tongue; and that he did not write\r\n",
      "his Gospel, till by long converse with the _Asiatick_ Greeks he had left\r\n",
      "off most of the _Hebraisms_. It is confirmed also by the many false\r\n",
      "_Apocalypses_, as those of _Peter_, _Paul_, _Thomas_, _Stephen_, _Elias_\r\n",
      "and _Cerinthus_, written in imitation of the true one. For as the many\r\n",
      "false Gospels, false Acts, and false Epistles were occasioned by true ones;\r\n",
      "and the writing many false _Apocalypses_, and ascribing them to Apostles\r\n",
      "and Prophets, argues that there was a true Apostolic one in great request\r\n",
      "with the first _Christians_: so this true one may well be suppos'd to have\r\n",
      "been written early, that there may be room in the Apostolic age for the\r\n",
      "writing of so many false ones afterwards, and fathering them upon _Peter_,\r\n",
      "_Paul_, _Thomas_ and others, who were dead before _John_. _Caius_, who was\r\n",
      "contemporary with _Tertullian_, [7] tells us that _Cerinthus_ wrote his\r\n",
      "Revelations as a great Apostle, and pretended the visions were shewn him by\r\n",
      "Angels, asserting a _millennium_ of carnal pleasures at _Jerusalem_ after\r\n",
      "the resurrection; so that his _Apocalypse_ was plainly written in imitation\r\n",
      "of _John_'s: and yet he lived so early, that [8] he resisted the Apostles\r\n",
      "at _Jerusalem_ in or before the first year of _Claudius_, that is, 26 years\r\n",
      "before the death of _Nero_, and [9] died before _John_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These reasons may suffice for determining the time; and yet there is one\r\n",
      "more, which to considering men may seem a good reason, to others not. I'll\r\n",
      "propound it, and leave it to every man's judgment. The _Apocalypse_ seems\r\n",
      "to be alluded to in the Epistles of _Peter_ and that to the _Hebrews_ and\r\n",
      "therefore to have been written before them. Such allusions in the Epistle\r\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_, I take to be the discourses concerning the High-Priest in\r\n",
      "the heavenly Tabernacle, who is both Priest and King, as was _Melchisedec_;\r\n",
      "and those concerning the _word of God_, with the _sharp two-edged sword_,\r\n",
      "the [Greek: sabbatismos], or _millennial_ rest, the _earth whose end is to\r\n",
      "be burned_, suppose by the lake of fire, _the judgment and fiery\r\n",
      "indignation which shall devour the adversaries_, the _heavenly City which\r\n",
      "hath foundations whose builder and maker is God_, the _cloud of witnesses,\r\n",
      "mount _Sion_, heavenly _Jerusalem_, general assembly, spirits of just men\r\n",
      "made perfect_, viz. by the resurrection, and _the shaking of heaven and\r\n",
      "earth, and removing them, that the new heaven, new earth and new kingdom\r\n",
      "which cannot be shaken, may remain_. In the first of _Peter_ occur these:\r\n",
      "[10] _The Revelation of Jesus Christ_, twice or thrice repeated; [11] the\r\n",
      "_blood of _Christ_ as of a Lamb foreordained before the foundation of the\r\n",

      "banished _John_ into _Patmos_. It seems also probable to me that the\r\n",
      "_Apocalypse_ was there composed, and that soon after the Epistle to the\r\n",
      "_Hebrews_ and those of _Peter_ were written to these Churches, with\r\n",
      "reference to this Prophecy as what they were particularly concerned in. For\r\n",

      "Empire made war upon the _Jews_; for till then the heathens were at peace\r\n",
      "with the _Christian Jews_, as well as with the rest. The Epistle to the\r\n",
      "_Hebrews_, since it mentions _Timothy_ as related to those _Hebrews_, must\r\n",

      "captivity, like that under old _Babylon_, as with respect to that name in\r\n",
      "the _Apocalypse_: and in writing _to the strangers scattered thro'out\r\n",

      "[29] _Justin_ and [30] _Irenæus_ say, that _Simon Magus_ came to _Rome_ in\r\n",
      "the reign of _Claudius_, and exercised juggling tricks there.\r\n",
      "_Pseudo-Clemens_ adds, that he endeavoured there to fly, but broke his neck\r\n",
      "thro' the prayers of _Peter_. Whence [31] _Eusebius_, or rather his\r\n",

      "Indeed the antienter tradition was, that _Peter_ came to _Rome_ in the days\r\n",
      "of this Emperor, as may be seen in [33] _Lactantius_. _Chrysostom_ [34]\r\n",
      "tells us, that the Apostles continued long in _Judea_, and that then being\r\n",
      "driven out by the _Jews_ they went to the _Gentiles_. This dispersion was\r\n",
      "in the first year of the _Jewish_ war, when the _Jews_, as _Josephus_ tells\r\n",
      "us, began to be tumultuous and violent in all places. For all agree that\r\n",
      "the Apostles were dispersed into several regions at once; and _Origen_ has\r\n",
      "set down the time, [35] telling us that in the beginning of the _Judaic_\r\n",
      "war, the Apostles and disciples of our Lord were scattered into all\r\n",
      "nations; _Thomas_ into _Parthia_, _Andrew_ into _Scythia_, _John_ into\r\n",
      "_Asia_, and _Peter_ first into _Asia_, where he preacht to the dispersion,\r\n",
      "and thence into _Italy_. [36] _Dionysius Corinthius_ saith, that _Peter_\r\n",

      "_Peter_ and _Paul_ were martyred there in the end of _Nero_'s reign. _Mark_\r\n",
      "went with _Timothy_ to _Rome_, 2 _Tim._ iv. 11. _Colos._ iv. 10. _Sylvanus_\r\n",

      "is no Epistle of _Paul_ to these strangers besides that to the _Hebrews_,\r\n",
      "so in this Epistle, chap. x. 11, 12. we find at large all those things\r\n",
      "which _Peter_ had been speaking of, and here refers to; particularly the\r\n",
      "_passing away of the old heavens and earth_, and _establishing an\r\n",
      "inheritance immoveable_, with an exhortation to grace, because _God_, to\r\n",

      "about the truth of it, since it was in such request with the first ages,\r\n",
      "that many endeavoured to imitate it, by feigning _Apocalypses_ under the\r\n",
      "Apostles names; and the Apostles themselves, as I have just now shewed,\r\n",
      "studied it, and used its phrases; by which means the style of the Epistle\r\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_ became more mystical than that of _Paul_'s other Epistles,\r\n",
      "and the style of _John_'s Gospel more figurative and majestical than that\r\n",
      "of the other Gospels. I do not apprehend that _Christ_ was called the word\r\n",
      "of God in any book of the New Testament written before the _Apocalypse_;\r\n",

      "being _the light which enlightens the world, the lamb of God which taketh\r\n",
      "away the sins of the world, the bridegroom, he that testifieth, he that\r\n",
      "came down from heaven, the Son of God_, &c. _Justin Martyr_, who within\r\n",
      "thirty years after _John_'s death became a _Christian_, writes expresly\r\n",
      "that _a certain man among the _Christians_ whose name was _John_, one of\r\n",
      "the twelve Apostles of _Christ_, in the Revelation which was shewed him,\r\n",
      "prophesied that those who believed in _Christ_ should live a thousand years\r\n",
      "at _Jerusalem__. And a few lines before he saith: _But I, and as many as\r\n",
      "are _Christians_, in all things right in their opinions, believe both that\r\n",
      "there shall be a resurrection of the flesh, and a thousand years life at\r\n",
      "_Jerusalem_ built, adorned and enlarged_. Which is as much as to say, that\r\n",
      "all true _Christians_ in that early age received this Prophecy: for in all\r\n",
      "ages, as many as believed the thousand years, received the _Apocalypse_ as\r\n",
      "the foundation of their opinion: and I do not know one instance to the\r\n",
      "contrary. _Papias_ Bishop of _Hierapolis_, a man of the Apostolic age, and\r\n",
      "one of _John_'s own disciples, did not only teach the doctrine of the\r\n",
      "thousand years, but also [37] asserted the _Apocalypse_ as written by\r\n",
      "divine inspiration. _Melito_, who flourished next after _Justin_, [38]\r\n",
      "wrote a commentary upon this Prophecy; and he, being Bishop of _Sardis_ one\r\n",
      "of the seven Churches, could neither be ignorant of their tradition about\r\n",
      "it, nor impose upon them. _Irenæus_, who was contemporary with _Melito_,\r\n",
      "wrote much upon it, and said, that _the number 666 was in all the antient\r\n",
      "and approved copies; and that he had it also confirmed to him by those who\r\n",
      "had seen _John_ face to face_, meaning no doubt his master _Polycarp_ for\r\n",
      "one. At the same time [39] _Theophilus_ Bishop of _Antioch_ asserted it,\r\n",
      "and so did _Tertullian_, _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and _Origen_ soon after;\r\n",
      "and their contemporary _Hippolytus_ the Martyr, Metropolitan of the\r\n",
      "_Arabians_, [40] wrote a commentary upon it. All these were antient men,\r\n",
      "flourishing within a hundred and twenty years after _John_'s death, and of\r\n",
      "greatest note in the Churches of those times. Soon after did _Victorinus\r\n",
      "Pictaviensis_ write another commentary upon it; and he lived in the time of\r\n",
      "_Dioclesian_. This may surely suffice to shew how the _Apocalypse_ was\r\n",
      "received and studied in the first ages: and I do not indeed find any other\r\n",
      "book of the New Testament so strongly attested, or commented upon so early\r\n",
      "as this. The Prophecy said: _Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear\r\n",
      "the words of this Prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein._\r\n",
      "This animated the first _Christians_ to study it so much, till the\r\n",
      "difficulty made them remit, and comment more upon the other books of the\r\n",
      "New Testament. This was the state of the _Apocalypse_, till the thousand\r\n",
      "years being misunderstood, brought a prejudice against it: and _Dionysius_\r\n",
      "of _Alexandria_, noting how it abounded with barbarisms, that is with\r\n",
      "_Hebraisms_, promoted that prejudice so far, as to cause many _Greeks_ in\r\n",
      "the fourth century to doubt of the book. But whilst the _Latins_, and a\r\n",
      "great part of the _Greeks_, always retained the _Apocalypse_, and the rest\r\n",
      "doubted only out of prejudice, it makes nothing against its authority.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This Prophecy is called _the Revelation_, with respect to _the scripture of\r\n",
      "truth_, which _Daniel_ [41] was commanded to _shut up and seal, till the\r\n",
      "time of the end_. _Daniel_ sealed it _until the time of the end_; and until\r\n",
      "that time comes, the Lamb is opening the seals: and afterwards the two\r\n",
      "Witnesses prophesy out of it a long time in sack-cloth, before they ascend\r\n",
      "up to heaven in a cloud. All which is as much as to say, that these\r\n",
      "Prophecies of _Daniel_ and _John_ should not be understood till the time of\r\n",
      "the end: but then some should prophesy out of them in an afflicted and\r\n",
      "mournful state for a long time, and that but darkly, so as to convert but\r\n",
      "few. But in the very end, the Prophecy should be so far interpreted as to\r\n",
      "convince many. _Then_, saith _Daniel, many shall run to and fro, and\r\n",
      "knowledge shall be encreased_. For the Gospel must be preached in all\r\n",
      "nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world. The\r\n",
      "palm-bearing multitude, which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be\r\n",
      "innumerable out of all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of\r\n",
      "the Gospel before it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain\r\n",
      "without hands, before it can fall upon the toes of the Image, and become a\r\n",
      "great mountain and fill the earth. An Angel must fly thro' the midst of\r\n",
      "heaven with the everlasting Gospel to preach to all nations, before\r\n",
      "_Babylon_ falls, and the Son of man reaps his harvest. The two Prophets\r\n",
      "must ascend up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms of this world\r\n",
      "become the kingdoms of _Christ_. 'Tis therefore a part of this Prophecy,\r\n",
      "that it should not be understood before the last age of the world; and\r\n",
      "therefore it makes for the credit of the Prophecy, that it is not yet\r\n",
      "understood. But if the last age, the age of opening these things, be now\r\n",
      "approaching, as by the great successes of late Interpreters it seems to be,\r\n",
      "we have more encouragement than ever to look into these things. If the\r\n",
      "general preaching of the Gospel be approaching, it is to us and our\r\n",
      "posterity that those words mainly belong: [42] _In the time of the end the\r\n",
      "wise shall understand, but none of the wicked shall understand. [43]\r\n",
      "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy,\r\n",
      "and keep those things which are written therein._\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The folly of Interpreters has been, to foretel times and things by this\r\n",
      "Prophecy, as if God designed to make them Prophets. By this rashness they\r\n",
      "have not only exposed themselves, but brought the Prophecy also into\r\n",
      "contempt. The design of God was much otherwise. He gave this and the\r\n",
      "Prophecies of the Old Testament, not to gratify men's curiosities by\r\n",
      "enabling them to foreknow things, but that after they were fulfilled they\r\n",
      "might be interpreted by the event, and his own Providence, not the\r\n",
      "Interpreters, be then manifested thereby to the world. For the event of\r\n",
      "things predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument that\r\n",
      "the world is governed by providence. For as the few and obscure Prophecies\r\n",
      "concerning _Christ_'s first coming were for setting up the _Christian_\r\n",
      "religion, which all nations have since corrupted; so the many and clear\r\n",
      "Prophecies concerning the things to be done at _Christ_'s second coming,\r\n",
      "are not only for predicting but also for effecting a recovery and\r\n",
      "re-establishment of the long-lost truth, and setting up a kingdom wherein\r\n",
      "dwells righteousness. The event will prove the _Apocalypse_; and this\r\n",
      "Prophecy, thus proved and understood, will open the old Prophets, and all\r\n",
      "together will make known the true religion, and establish it. For he that\r\n",
      "will understand the old Prophets, must begin with this; but the time is not\r\n",
      "yet come for understanding them perfectly, because the main revolution\r\n",
      "predicted in them is not yet come to pass. _In the days of the voice of the\r\n",
      "seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be\r\n",
      "finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets_: and then _the\r\n",
      "kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his\r\n",
      "_Christ_, and he shall reign for ever_, Apoc. x. 7. xi. 15. There is\r\n",
      "already so much of the Prophecy fulfilled, that as many as will take pains\r\n",
      "in this study, may see sufficient instances of God's providence: but then\r\n",
      "the signal revolutions predicted by all the holy Prophets, will at once\r\n",
      "both turn mens eyes upon considering the predictions, and plainly interpret\r\n",

      "Amongst the Interpreters of the last age there is scarce one of note who\r\n",

      "Eagle, as the _Jews_ affirm. Whence were framed the hieroglyphicks of\r\n",
      "_Cherubims_ and _Seraphims_, to represent the people of _Israel_. A\r\n",
      "_Cherubim_ had one body with four faces, the faces of a Lion, an Ox, a Man\r\n",
      "and an Eagle, looking to the four winds of heaven, without turning about,\r\n",

      "whom the hundred forty and four thousand were sealed, _Apoc._ vii. 4. _And\r\n",
      "the four Beasts had each of them six wings_, two to a tribe, in all twenty\r\n",
      "and four wings, answering to the twenty and four stations of the people.\r\n",
      "_And they were full of eyes within_, or under their wings. _And they rest\r\n",
      "not day and night_, or at the morning and evening-sacrifices, _saying,\r\n",
      "holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come_.\r\n",
      "These animals are therefore the Seraphims, which appeared to _Isaiah_ [1]\r\n",

      "and the song being ended, the people prayed standing, till the solemnity\r\n",

      "_Christians_ in their Churches is here represented under the form of\r\n",
      "worshiping God and the Lamb in the Temple: God for his benefaction in\r\n",

      "his blood: God as sitting upon the throne and living for ever, and the Lamb\r\n",
      "as exalted above all by the merits of his death. _And I heard_, saith\r\n",
      "_John_, _the voice of many Angels round about the throne, and the Beasts\r\n",
      "and the Elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand,\r\n",
      "and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb\r\n",
      "that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and\r\n",
      "honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and\r\n",

      "wherein the service, which was various and intricate, was wholly to be\r\n",

      "on other days, for one of the Priests to take fire from the great Altar in\r\n",
      "a silver Censer; but on this day, for the High-Priest to take fire from the\r\n",
      "great Altar in a golden Censer: and when he was come down from the great\r\n",
      "Altar, he took incense from one of the Priests who brought it to him, and\r\n",
      "went with it to the golden Altar: and while he offered the incense, the\r\n",
      "people prayed without in silence, which is the silence in heaven for half\r\n",
      "an hour. When the High-Priest had laid the incense on the Altar, he carried\r\n",
      "a Censer of it burning in his hand, into the most holy place before the\r\n",
      "Ark. _And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the Saints,\r\n",

      "certain measure of incense for the golden Altar: on this day there was a\r\n",
      "greater quantity for both the Altar and the most holy Place, and therefore\r\n",

      "voices, which are the musick of the Temple, and singing of the _Levites_,\r\n",
      "intermixed with the soundings of the trumpets: and the seven Angels pour\r\n",

      "in the outward court, the two witnesses, represented perhaps by the two\r\n",

      "Testament_. By the Ark, we may know that this was the first Temple; for the\r\n",
      "second Temple had no Ark. _And there were lightnings, and voices, and\r\n",
      "thundrings, and an earthquake, and great hail_. These answer to the wars in\r\n",

      "upon opening the first four seals. _And there appeared a great wonder in\r\n",

      "Church begin to be considered at the opening of the fifth seal; and in the\r\n",
      "Interpretation, they begin at the same time with the vision of the Church\r\n",
      "in the form of a woman in heaven: there she is persecuted, and here she is\r\n",
      "pained in travail. The Interpretation proceeds down first to the sealing of\r\n",
      "the servants of God, and marking the rest with the mark of the Beast; and\r\n",
      "then to the day of judgment, represented by a harvest and vintage. Then it\r\n",

      "The whole scene of sacred Prophecy is composed of three principal parts:\r\n",
      "the regions beyond _Euphrates_, represented by the two first Beasts of\r\n",
      "_Daniel_; the Empire of the _Greeks_ on this side of _Euphrates_,\r\n",
      "represented by the Leopard and by the He-Goat; and the Empire of the\r\n",
      "_Latins_ on this side of _Greece_, represented by the Beast with ten horns.\r\n",
      "And to these three parts, the phrases of the _third part of the earth, sea,\r\n",
      "rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun, and moon_, relate. I place the body of\r\n",
      "the fourth Beast on this side of _Greece_, because the three first of the\r\n",
      "four Beasts had their lives prolonged after their dominion was taken away,\r\n",
      "and therefore belong not to the body of the fourth. He only stamped them\r\n",
      "with his feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the _earth_, the _Jews_ understood the great continent of all _Asia_ and\r\n",
      "_Africa_, to which they had access by land: and by the Isles of the _sea_,\r\n",
      "they understood the places to which they sailed by sea, particularly all\r\n",
      "_Europe_: and hence in this Prophecy, the _earth_ and _sea_ are put for the\r\n",
      "nations of the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The third and fourth Beasts of _Daniel_ are the same with the Dragon and\r\n",
      "ten-horned Beast of _John_, but with this difference: _John_ puts the\r\n",
      "Dragon for the whole _Roman_ Empire while it continued entire, because it\r\n",
      "was entire when that Prophecy was given; and the Beast he considers not\r\n",
      "till the Empire became divided: and then he puts the Dragon for the Empire\r\n",
      "of the _Greeks_, and the Beast for the Empire of the _Latins_. Hence it is\r\n",
      "that the Dragon and Beast have common heads and common horns: but the\r\n",
      "Dragon hath crowns only upon his heads, and the Beast only upon his horns;\r\n",
      "because the Beast and his horns reigned not before they were divided from\r\n",
      "the Dragon: and when the Dragon gave the Beast his throne, the ten horns\r\n",
      "received power as Kings, the same hour with the Beast. The heads are seven\r\n",
      "successive Kings. Four of them were the four horsemen which appeared at the\r\n",
      "opening of the first four seals. In the latter end of the sixth head, or\r\n",
      "seal, considered as present in the visions, it is said, _five_ of the seven\r\n",
      "Kings _are fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come; and the Beast\r\n",
      "that was and is not_, being wounded to death with a sword, _he is the\r\n",
      "eighth, and of the seven_: he was therefore a collateral part of the\r\n",
      "seventh. The horns are the same with those of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast,\r\n",
      "described above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The four horsemen which appear at the opening of the first four seals, have\r\n",
      "been well explained by Mr. _Mede_; excepting that I had rather continue the\r\n",
      "third to the end of the reign of the three _Gordians_ and _Philip_ the\r\n",
      "_Arabian_, those being Kings from the _South_, and begin the fourth with\r\n",
      "the reign of _Decius_, and continue it till the reign of _Dioclesian_. For\r\n",
      "the fourth horseman _sat upon a pale_ horse, _and his name was Death; and\r\n",
      "hell followed with him; and power was given them to kill unto the fourth\r\n",
      "part of the earth, with the sword, and with famine, and with the plague,\r\n",
      "and with the Beasts of the earth_, or armies of invaders and rebels: and as\r\n",
      "such were the times during all this interval. Hitherto the _Roman_ Empire\r\n",
      "continued in an undivided monarchical form, except rebellions; and such it\r\n",

      "himself and _Maximianus_, A.C. 285; and it continued in that divided state,\r\n",
      "till the victory of _Constantine_ the great over _Licinius_, A.C. 323,\r\n",
      "which put an end to the heathen persecutions set on foot by _Dioclesian_\r\n",

      "division of the Empire was imperfect, the whole being still under one and\r\n",
      "the same Senate. The same victory of _Constantine_ over _Licinius_ a\r\n",
      "heathen persecutor, began the fall of the heathen Empire, described at the\r\n",

      "degenerated like _Aholah_ and _Aholibah_. In _Diocesian_'s persecution _she\r\n",

      "that persecution, by the victory of _Constantine_ over _Maxentius_ A.C.\r\n",
      "312, _she brought forth a man-child_, such a child as _was to rule all\r\n",

      "victory of _Constantine_ over _Licinius_, A.C. 323, _was caught up unto God\r\n",

      "_And none was found worthy to open the book_ till the Lamb of God appeared;\r\n",
      "the great High-Priest represented by a lamb slain at the foot of the Altar\r\n",
      "in the morning-sacrifice. _And he came, and took the book out of the hand\r\n",
      "of him that sat upon the throne._ For the High-Priest, in the feast of the\r\n",
      "seventh month, went into the most holy place, and took the book of the law\r\n",
      "out of the right side of the Ark, to read it to the people: and in order to\r\n",
      "read it well, he studied it seven days, that is, upon the fourth, fifth,\r\n",
      "sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth days, being attended by some of the\r\n",
      "priests to hear him perform. These seven days are alluded to, by the Lamb's\r\n",
      "opening the seven seals successively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon the tenth day of the month, a young bullock was offered for a\r\n",
      "sin-offering for the High-Priest, and a goat for a sin-offering for the\r\n",
      "people: and lots were cast upon two goats to determine which of them should\r\n",
      "be God's lot for the sin-offering; and the other goat was called _Azazel_,\r\n",
      "the scape-goat. The High-Priest in his linen garments, took a censer full\r\n",
      "of burning coals of fire from the Altar, his hand being full of sweet\r\n",
      "incense beaten small; and went into the most holy place within the veil,\r\n",
      "and put the incense upon the fire, and sprinkled the blood of the bullock\r\n",
      "with his finger upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat seven times;\r\n",
      "and then he killed the goat which fell to God's lot, for a sin-offering for\r\n",
      "the people, and brought his blood within the veil, and sprinkled it also\r\n",
      "seven times upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat. Then he went out\r\n",
      "to the Altar, and sprinkled it also seven times with the blood of the\r\n",
      "bullock, and as often with the blood of the goat. After this _he laid both\r\n",
      "his hands upon the head of the live goat; and confessed over him all the\r\n",
      "iniquities of the children of _Israel_, and all their transgressions in all\r\n",
      "their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat; and sent him away into\r\n",
      "the wilderness by the hands of a fit man: and the goat bore upon him all\r\n",
      "their iniquities into a land not inhabited_, Levit. chap. iv. & chap. xvi.\r\n",
      "While the High-Priest was doing these things in the most holy place and at\r\n",
      "the Altar, the people continued at their devotion quietly and in silence.\r\n",
      "Then the High-Priest went into the holy place, put off his linen garments,\r\n",
      "and put on other garments; then came out, and sent the bullock and the goat\r\n",
      "of the sin-offering to be burnt without the camp, with fire taken in a\r\n",
      "censer from the Altar: and as the people returned home from the Temple,\r\n",
      "they said to one another, _God seal you to a good new year_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In allusion to all this, _when he had opened the seventh seal, there was\r\n",
      "silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And an Angel stood at\r\n",
      "the Altar having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much\r\n",
      "incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints, upon the\r\n",
      "golden Altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense with\r\n",
      "the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand.\r\n",
      "And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of the Altar, and\r\n",
      "cast it to the earth_, suppose without the camp, for sacrificing the goat\r\n",
      "which fell to God's lot. For the High-Priest being _Christ_ himself, the\r\n",
      "bullock is omitted. At this sacrifice _there were voices and thundrings_,\r\n",
      "of the musick of the Temple, _and lightnings_ of the sacred fire, _and an\r\n",
      "earthquake_: and synchronal to these things was the sealing of _the 144000\r\n",
      "out of all the twelve tribes of the children of _Israel_ with the seal of\r\n",
      "God in their foreheads_, while the rest of the twelve tribes received the\r\n",
      "mark of the Beast, and the Woman fled from the Temple into the wilderness\r\n",
      "to her place upon this Beast. For this sealing and marking was represented\r\n",
      "by casting lots upon the two goats, sacrificing God's lot on mount _Sion_,\r\n",
      "and sending the scape-goat into the wilderness loaden with the sins of the\r\n",
      "people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon the fifteenth day of the month, and the six following days, there were\r\n",
      "very great sacrifices. And in allusion to the sounding of trumpets, and\r\n",
      "singing with thundring voices, and pouring out drink-offerings at those\r\n",
      "sacrifices, _seven trumpets are sounded_, and _seven thunders utter their\r\n",
      "voices_, and _seven vials of wrath are poured out_. Wherefore the sounding\r\n",
      "of the _seven trumpets_, the voices of the _seven thunders_, and the\r\n",
      "pouring out of the _seven vials of wrath_, are synchronal, and relate to\r\n",
      "one and the same division of the time of the seventh seal following the\r\n",
      "silence, into seven successive parts. The seven days of this feast were\r\n",
      "called the feast of Tabernacles; and during these seven days the children\r\n",
      "of _Israel_ dwelt in booths, and rejoiced with palm-branches in their\r\n",
      "hands. To this alludes _the multitude with palms in their hands_, which\r\n",
      "appeared after the sealing of the 144000, and _came out of the great\r\n",
      "tribulation_ with triumph at the battle of the great day, to which the\r\n",
      "seventh trumpet sounds. The visions therefore of the 144000, and of the\r\n",
      "palm-bearing multitude, extend to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and\r\n",
      "therefore are synchronal to the times of the seventh seal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the 144000 _are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of _Israel__, and\r\n",
      "the rest receive _the mark of the Beast_, and thereby the first temple is\r\n",
      "destroyed; _John_ is bidden to _measure the temple and altar_, that is,\r\n",
      "their courts, _and them that worship therein_, that is, the 144000 standing\r\n",
      "on mount _Sion_ and on the sea of glass: _but the court that is without the\r\n",
      "temple_, that is, the peoples court, to _leave out and measure it not,\r\n",
      "because it is given to the_ Gentiles, those who receive the mark of the\r\n",
      "Beast; _and the holy city they shall tread under foot forty and two\r\n",
      "months_, that is, all the time that the Beast acts under the woman\r\n",
      "_Babylon_: and _the two witnesses prophesy 1260 days_, that is, all the\r\n",
      "same time, _clothed in sackcloth. These have power_, like _Elijah, to shut\r\n",
      "heaven that it rain not_, at the sounding of the first trumpet; and, like\r\n",
      "_Moses, to turn the waters into blood_ at the sounding of the second; _and\r\n",
      "to smite the earth with all plagues_, those of the trumpets, _as often as\r\n",
      "they will_. These prophesy at the building of the second temple, like\r\n",
      "_Haggai_ and _Zechary_. These are _the two Olive-trees_, or Churches, which\r\n",
      "_supplied the lamps with oil_, _Zech._ iv. These are _the two\r\n",
      "candlesticks_, or Churches, _standing before the God of the earth_. Five of\r\n",
      "the seven Churches of _Asia_, those in prosperity, are found fault with,\r\n",
      "and exhorted to repent, and threatned to be _removed out of their places_,\r\n",
      "or _spewed out of _Christ's_ mouth_, or _punished with the sword of\r\n",
      "_Christ's_ mouth, except they repent_: the other two, the Churches of\r\n",
      "_Smyrna_ and _Philadelphia_, which were under persecution, remain in a\r\n",
      "state of persecution, to illuminate the second temple. When the primitive\r\n",
      "Church catholick, represented by _the woman in heaven_, apostatized, and\r\n",
      "became divided into two corrupt Churches, represented by the _whore of\r\n",
      "_Babylon__ and the _two-horned Beast_, the 144000 _who were sealed out of\r\n",
      "all the twelve tribes_, became the _two Witnesses_, in opposition to those\r\n",
      "two false Churches: and the name of _two Witnesses_ once imposed, remains\r\n",
      "to the true Church of God in all times and places to the end of the\r\n",
      "Prophecy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the interpretation of this Prophecy, _the woman in heaven clothed with\r\n",
      "the sun_, before she flies into the wilderness, represents the primitive\r\n",
      "Church catholick, illuminated with the _seven lamps_ in the _seven golden\r\n",
      "candlesticks_, which are the _seven Churches_ of _Asia_. The Dragon\r\n",
      "signifies the same Empire with _Daniel_'s He-goat in the reign of his last\r\n",
      "horn, that is, the whole _Roman_ Empire, until it became divided into the\r\n",
      "_Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires; and all the time of that division it signifies\r\n",
      "the _Greek_ Empire alone: and the Beast is _Daniel_'s fourth Beast, that\r\n",
      "is, the Empire of the _Latins_. Before the division of the _Roman_ Empire\r\n",
      "into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, the Beast is included in the body of\r\n",
      "the Dragon; and from the time of that division, the Beast is the _Latin_\r\n",
      "Empire only. Hence the Dragon and Beast have the same heads and horns; but\r\n",
      "the heads are crowned upon the Dragon, and the horns upon the Beast. The\r\n",
      "horns are ten kingdoms, into which the Beast becomes divided presently\r\n",
      "after his separation from the Dragon, as hath been described above. The\r\n",
      "heads are seven successive dynasties, or parts, into which the _Roman_\r\n",
      "Empire becomes divided by the opening of the seven seals. Before the woman\r\n",
      "fled into the wilderness, _she being with child_ of a Christian Empire,\r\n",
      "_cried travelling_, viz. in the ten years persecution of _Dioclesian_, _and\r\n",
      "pained to be delivered: and the Dragon_, the heathen _Roman_ Empire, _stood\r\n",
      "before her, to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought\r\n",
      "forth a man child, who_ at length _was to rule all nations with a rod of\r\n",
      "iron. And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne_ in the\r\n",
      "Temple, by the victory of _Constantine_ the great over _Maxentius_: _and\r\n",
      "the woman fled_ from the Temple _into the wilderness_ of _Arabia_ to\r\n",
      "_Babylon_, _where she hath a place_ of riches and honour and dominion, upon\r\n",
      "the back of the Beast, _prepared of God, that they should feed her there\r\n",
      "1260 days. And there was war in heaven_, between the heathens under\r\n",
      "_Maximinus_ and the new Christian Empire; _and the great Dragon was cast\r\n",
      "out, that old serpent, which deceiveth the whole world_, the spirit of\r\n",
      "heathen idolatry; _he was cast out_ of the throne _into the earth. And they\r\n",
      "overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;\r\n",
      "and they loved not their lives unto the death_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_And when the Dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the\r\n",
      "woman which brought forth the man child_, stirring up a new persecution\r\n",
      "against her in the reign of _Licinius_. _And to the woman_, by the building\r\n",
      "of _Constantinople_ and equalling it to _Rome_, _were given two wings of a\r\n",
      "great eagle, that she might flee into the wilderness into her place_ upon\r\n",
      "the back of her Beast, _where she is nourished for a time, and times, and\r\n",
      "half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent_, upon the death\r\n",
      "of _Constantine_ the great, _cast out of his mouth water as a flood_, viz.\r\n",
      "the _Western_ Empire under _Constantine junior_ and _Constans_, _after the\r\n",
      "woman: that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the\r\n",
      "earth_, the nations of _Asia_ now under _Constantinople_, _helped the\r\n",
      "woman_; and by conquering the _Western_ Empire, now under _Magnentius_,\r\n",
      "_swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth. And the\r\n",

      "her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of\r\n",
      "_Jesus Christ_, which_ in that war _were sealed out of all the twelve\r\n",
      "tribes of _Israel__, and remained upon mount _Sion_ with the Lamb, being in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the earth had swallowed up the flood, and the Dragon was gone to make\r\n",
      "war with the remnant of the woman's seed, _John stood upon the sand of the\r\n",
      "sea, and saw a Beast rise out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns.\r\n",
      "And the Beast was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a\r\n",
      "Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion._ _John_ here names _Daniel_'s\r\n",
      "four Beasts in order, putting his Beast in the room of _Daniel_'s fourth\r\n",
      "Beast, to shew that they are the same. _And the Dragon gave_ this Beast\r\n",
      "_his power and his seat and great authority_, by relinquishing the\r\n",
      "_Western_ Empire to him. _And one of his heads_, the sixth, was _as it were\r\n",
      "wounded to death_, viz. by the sword of the earth, which swallowed up the\r\n",
      "waters cast out of the mouth of the Dragon; _and his deadly wound was\r\n",
      "healed_, by a new division of the Empire between _Valentinian_ and\r\n",
      "_Valens_, _An._ 364. _John_ saw the Beast rise out of the sea, at the\r\n",
      "division thereof between _Gratian_ and _Theodosius_, _An._ 379. The Dragon\r\n",
      "gave the Beast his power, and his seat and great authority, at the death of\r\n",
      "_Theodosius_, when _Theodosius_ gave the _Western_ Empire to his son\r\n",
      "_Honorius_. After which the two Empires were no more united: but the\r\n",
      "_Western_ Empire became presently divided into ten kingdoms, as above; and\r\n",
      "these kingdoms at length united in religion under the woman, and reign with\r\n",
      "her _forty and two months_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_And I beheld_, saith _John_, _another Beast coming up out of the earth._\r\n",
      "When the woman fled from the Dragon into the kingdom of the Beast, and\r\n",
      "became his Church, this other Beast rose up out of the earth, to represent\r\n",
      "the Church of the Dragon. For _he had two horns like the Lamb_, such as\r\n",
      "were the bishopricks of _Alexandria_ and _Antioch_: _and he spake as the\r\n",
      "Dragon_ in matters of religion: _and he causeth the earth_, or nations of\r\n",
      "the Dragon's kingdom, _to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was\r\n",
      "healed_, that is, to be of his religion. _And he doth great wonders, so\r\n",
      "that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of\r\n",
      "men_; that is, he excommunicateth those who differ from him in point of\r\n",
      "religion: for in pronouncing their excommunications, they used to swing\r\n",
      "down a lighted torch from above. _And he said to them that dwell on the\r\n",
      "earth, that they should make an image to the Beast, which had the wound by\r\n",
      "a sword, and did live_; that is, that they should call a Council of men of\r\n",
      "the religion of this Beast. _And he had power to give life unto the image\r\n",
      "of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that\r\n",
      "as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed_, viz.\r\n",
      "mystically, by dissolving their Churches. _And he causeth all both small\r\n",
      "and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right\r\n",
      "band or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, save he that\r\n",
      "had the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name_; that\r\n",
      "is, the mark [Cross], or the name [Greek: LATEINOS], or the number thereof\r\n",
      "[Greek: chxs], 666. All others were excommunicated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the seven Angels had poured out the seven vials of wrath, and _John_\r\n",
      "had described them all in the present time, he is called up from the time\r\n",
      "of the seventh vial to the time of the sixth seal, to take a view of the\r\n",
      "woman and her Beast, who were to reign in the times of the seventh seal. In\r\n",
      "respect of the latter part of time of the sixth seal, then considered as\r\n",
      "present, the Angel tells _John_: _The Beast that thou sawest, was and is\r\n",
      "not, and shall ascend out of the abyss, and go into perdition_; that is, he\r\n",
      "was in the reign of _Constans_ and _Magnentius_, until _Constantius_\r\n",
      "conquered _Magnentius_, and re-united the _Western_ Empire to the\r\n",
      "_Eastern_. He is not during the reunion, and he shall ascend out of the\r\n",
      "abyss or sea at a following division of the Empire. The Angel tells him\r\n",
      "further: _Here is the mind which hath wisdom: the seven heads are seven\r\n",
      "mountains, on which the woman sitteth_; _Rome_ being built upon seven\r\n",
      "hills, and thence called the seven-hilled city. _Also there are seven\r\n",
      "Kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when\r\n",
      "he cometh, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is\r\n",
      "not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition_.\r\n",
      "Five are fallen, the times of the five first seals being past; and one is,\r\n",
      "the time of the sixth seal being considered as present; and another is not\r\n",
      "yet come, and when he cometh, which will be at the opening of the seventh\r\n",
      "seal, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is not,\r\n",
      "even he is the eighth, by means of the division of the _Roman_ Empire into\r\n",
      "two collateral Empires; and is of the seven, being one half of the seventh,\r\n",
      "and shall go into perdition. The words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\r\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, are usually referred by interpreters to the\r\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, when the Prophecy was given: but it is to be\r\n",
      "considered, that in this Prophecy many things are spoken of as present,\r\n",
      "which were not present when the Prophecy was given, but which would be\r\n",
      "present with respect to some future time, considered as present in the\r\n",
      "visions. Thus where it is said upon pouring out the seventh vial of wrath,\r\n",
      "that _great _Babylon_ came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the\r\n",
      "cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath_; this relates not to the\r\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, but to the time of pouring out the seventh vial\r\n",
      "of wrath. So where it is said, _Babylon is fallen, is fallen_; and _thrust\r\n",
      "in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap_; and _the\r\n",
      "time of the dead is come, that they should be judged_; and again, _I saw\r\n",
      "the dead small and great stand before God_: these sayings relate not to the\r\n",
      "days of _John_ the Apostle, but to the latter times considered as present\r\n",
      "in the visions. In like manner the words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\r\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, and _the Beast that was and is not, he is the\r\n",
      "eighth_, are not to be referred to the age of _John_ the Apostle, but\r\n",
      "relate to the time when the Beast was to be wounded to death with a sword,\r\n",
      "and shew that this wound was to be given him in his sixth head: and without\r\n",
      "this reference we are not told in what head the Beast was wounded. _And the\r\n",
      "ten horns which thou sawest, are ten Kings, which have received no kingdom\r\n",
      "as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast. These have one\r\n",
      "mind_, being all of the whore's religion, _and shall give their power and\r\n",
      "strength unto the Beast. These shall make war with the Lamb_, at the\r\n",
      "sounding of the seventh trumpet; _and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he\r\n",
      "is Lord of Lords and King of Kings; and they that are with him are called\r\n",
      "and chosen and faithful. And he saith unto me, the waters which thou sawest\r\n",
      "where the whore sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and\r\n",
      "tongues_, composing her Beast. _And the ten horns which thou sawest upon\r\n",
      "the Beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and\r\n",
      "naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire_, at the end of the\r\n",
      "1260 days. _For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to\r\n",
      "agree and give their kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall\r\n",
      "be fulfilled. And the woman which thou sawest, is that great city which\r\n",
      "reigneth over the Kings of the earth_, or the great city of the _Latins_,\r\n",
      "which reigneth over the ten Kings till the end of those days.\r\n",
